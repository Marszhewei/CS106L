Assignment 3: STL HashMap (short answer questions)
Names:
1. we must overload at()
because operatopr[] call insert() method and it can't be const
2. m.find(k) is faster than std::find(m.begin(), m.end(), k)
because we call the find_node() method, and use "size_t index = _hash_function(key) % bucket_count()" in find_node(), but std::find is O(n)
3. initialize the variable when creating the object(by constructor), and free memory when the object out of scope(by destructor)
4. prefix operator++: check the end(), and if reaching the end of bucket, find the next bucket
postfix operator++: return the copy, and it does't need check end()
